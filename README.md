## Covid_tweets
Keyword "coronavirus" tweets from March 4, 2020 to May 20, 2020 before "covid" or "covid19" became popular; the dataset combined is more 84 million tweets in English. Each dataset is named based on the "week" (going from Wednesday to Wednesday as the data starts on a Wednesday) of the data and is condensed to 1 million observations (or less) per file. Thus, "covidwk1miniA" represents the first 1 million rows of week 1 of the data. As week 1 has 9,819,591 observations, the file ending in "J" will only have 819,591 observations. Similarly, "covidwk12miniA" is the only file for week 12 as there were only 607,514 observations. Four variables are in each dataset: created_at (i.e., the date of the tweet), username (i.e., the handle of the user), text (i.e,. the tweet itself), and location (i.e., information on user profile that the user put as his/her location).

To get the files, you will have to click on an individual zip file and download the raw file.
